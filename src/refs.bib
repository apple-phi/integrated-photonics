  abstract = {A method is described for calculation of the optical constants (the refractive index, extinction coefficient, and absorption coefficient) of some III-V binaries (GaP, GaAs, GaSb, InP, InAs, and InSb), ternaries (AlxGa1−xAs), and quaternaries (In1−xGaxAsyP1−y) in the entire range of photon energies (0–6.0 eV). The imaginary part of the dielectric function [ε2(ω)] is derived first from the joint density-of-states functions at energies of various critical points (CPs) in the Brillouin zone; then its real part [ε1(ω)] is obtained analytically using the Kramers–Kronig relation. The indirect band-gap transitions are also assumed to provide a gradually increasing ε2 spectrum expressed by a power law of (ℏω−EIDg)2, where ℏω is the photon energy and EIDg is the indirect band-gap energy. The optical dispersion relations are expressed in terms of these model dielectric functions. The present model reveals distinct structures in the optical constants at energies of the E0, E0+Δ0 [three-dimensional (3-D) M0 CP], E1, E1+Δ1 [3-D M1 or two-dimensional (2-D) M0 CP], and E2 or E′0 (triplet) (damped harmonic oscillator). Excellent agreement is achieved between our calculations and published experimental data for these semiconductors over a wide range of the photon energies.},

  abstract = {Multimode silicon photonics is attracting more and more attention because the introduction of higher-order modes makes it possible to increase the channel number for data transmission in mode-division-multiplexed (MDM) systems as well as improve the flexibility of device designs. On the other hand, the design of multimode silicon photonic devices becomes very different compared with the traditional case with the fundamental mode only. Since not only the fundamental mode but also the higher-order modes are involved, one of the most important things for multimode silicon photonics is the realization of effective mode manipulation, which is not difficult, fortunately because the mode dispersion in multimode silicon optical waveguide is very strong. Great progresses have been achieved on multimode silicon photonics in the past years. In this paper, a review of the recent progresses of the representative multimode silicon photonic devices and circuits is given. The first part reviews multimode silicon photonics for MDM systems, including on-chip multichannel mode (de)multiplexers, multimode waveguide bends, multimode waveguide crossings, reconfigurable multimode silicon photonic integrated circuits, multimode chip-fiber couplers, etc. In the second part, we give a discussion about the higher-order mode-assisted silicon photonic devices, including on-chip polarization-handling devices with higher-order modes, add-drop optical filters based on multimode Bragg gratings, and some emerging applications.},

We engineer the dispersion of the structure in the MIR using a Sellmeier equation we derive from experimental measurements performed on Si3N4 films from the UV to the IR. We use deposition–anneal cycling to decrease absorption losses due to vibrational transitions in the MIR and achieve a Q-factor of 1.0×106. To our knowledge, this is the highest Q reported in this wavelength range for any on-chip resonator.},

This collection, derived from a meticulous compilation of data sourced from peer-reviewed publications, manufacturers’ datasheets, and authoritative texts, aims to advance research in optics and photonics. The data is stored using a YAML-based format, ensuring integrity, consistency, and ease of access. Each record is accompanied by detailed metadata, facilitating a comprehensive understanding and efficient utilization of the data. In this descriptor, we outline the data curation protocols and the file format used for data records, and briefly demonstrate how the data can be organized in a user-friendly fashion akin to the books in a traditional library.},
